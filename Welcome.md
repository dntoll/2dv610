Hi

According to my list of possible students you are have, or may apply for the course Software Testing, 2dv610. 
Make sure you fulfill the prerequisites for the course, you might have gotten this email even if you do not fulfill them. 

If you are not going to take the course, or realise you do not fulfill the prerequisites, just ignore this email.

Otherwise:

You should participate on the Tuesday 3 November 09:15-12:00 In Kalmar Ny104K or online https://connect.sunet.se/softwaretesting/

Here is some quick information about the course:

The course-language is going to be English. Both lectures and course material are going to be in English. Questions may be asked in Swedish or English.

There are going to be some tight deadlines, make sure you plan for a lot of programming during the course. 
Start early and try to submit before deadline. 

The following communication strategy is going to be used in the course:
 * Most information will be provided through the course web page: Currently it contains last years configuration and dates. The course web page will be updated until course start. The course web page is here: https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/mjukvarutestning/ Make sure you tell us if you see an error or there is something missing. 
 * I will post on the course-web if something changes quickly, like a cancelled lecture.
 * Questions about the course or assignments SHOULD be asked in Slack! https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/ 
 * Questions of personal nature may be sent to my email address, with subject line starting with 2DV610. Questions that are non-personal will be answered in Slack and a short notice in the email. https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/ 
 * Lectures will contain important information about the assignments and course so attend them.
 * Lectures will be broadcasted through Adobe Connect. https://connect.sunet.se/softwaretesting/ Most of the time these are recorded and links to recordings will be posted, but participate in the online lectures! Some parts of the lectures may include work so you should make sure you have a working headset and preferably a webcam.
 * Lectures will also be on campus Kalmar.
 

TODO:
 * Join slack now since that will be your way of asking questions!
   https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/ 
   You have to register on slack to get access.
 * Download and install Eclipse, JUnit 4.

See you next week and I wish you an awesome course!
