Hi

According to my list of possible students you are have, or may apply for the course Software Testing, 2dv610. 
NOTICE. Make sure you fulfill the prerequisites for the course, you might have gotten this email even if you do not fulfill them. 

If you are not going to take the course, or realise you do not fulfill the prerequisites, just ignore this email.

Otherwise, read the following information carefully:

You should participate on one of the course-start-events:

* Option 1. Monday 31 October 10:15-11:15 In Kalmar Ny228K, or online https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ECu6oCOLic

* There is a tutoring on Thursday 3 November that is going to be dedicated to registration issues. (not mandatory)

Here is some quick information about the course :

* The course-language is going to be English. Both lectures and course material are going to be in English. Questions may be asked in Swedish or English.
* The course is mainly given in Kalmar with a few exceptions. Students from Växjö are supposed to attend the online tutoring and online lectures.
* There are going to be A LOT of students on this course, therefore we will make a lot of changes this year. Since I will change the assignments, this will take some time, therefore the assignment details will be delayed and released during the course. Make sure you follow the course news-flow on the course-web (or slack). 
* There are going to be some tight deadlines, make sure you plan for a lot of programming during the course. Start early and submit before deadline. I will release a deadline document shortly so that you can plan.

The following communication strategy is going to be used in the course:

 * Most information will be provided through the course web page: Currently it may contain last years configuration and dates. The course web page will be updated during the course. The course web page is here: https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/mjukvarutestning/ Make sure you tell us if you see an error or there is something missing. 
 * I will post on the course-web if something changes quickly, like a cancelled lecture, or when assignments are released or changed.
 * Questions about the course or assignments SHOULD primarely be asked in Slack! https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/ 
 * Questions of personal nature may be sent to my email address, with subject line starting with 2DV610. Questions that are non-personal will be answered in Slack and a short notice in the email. https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/ 
 * Lectures will contain important information about the assignments and course so attend them.
 * Lectures will be broadcasted on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ECu6oCOLic Normally these are recorded and links to recordings will be posted, but participate in the online lectures! Some parts of the lectures may include work so you should make sure you have a working headset and preferably a webcam. You can ask questions and interact through the YouTube chat.
 * Lectures will also be given on campus Kalmar.
 * Online Tutoring is normally done using Slack and Skype. Ask a question in Slack, if needed we have a conversation in Skype. 
 * The tutoring time should be used to get you started and are provided so that you can ask questions about the assignments
 

Your TODO list:

* Check your prerequisites and make sure you get registered on the course, use the Tutoring time on Thursday if there is a problem.
* Join slack now since that will be your way of asking questions! https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/  You have to register on slack to get access.
* Schedule one of the course start-events and attend it!  

See you next week and I wish you an awesome course!
