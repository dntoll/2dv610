The course is mainly given in Kalmar with a few exceptions. Students from Växjö are supposed to attend the online tutoring and online lectures.

There are going to be A LOT of students on this course, therefore we will make a lot of changes this year. Make sure you follow the course news-flow.

There are going to be some tight deadlines, make sure you plan for a lot of programming during the course. 
Start early and try to submit before deadline. 

The following communication strategy is going to be used in the course:
 * Most information will be provided through the course web page: Currently it contains last years configuration and dates. The course web page will be updated until course start. The course web page is here: https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/mjukvarutestning/ Make sure you tell us if you see an error or there is something missing. Since the course will be changed, a lot of the material will also be changed. 
 * I will post on the course-web if something changes quickly, like a cancelled lecture.
 * Questions about the course or assignments SHOULD be asked in Slack! https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/ 
 * Questions of personal nature may be sent to my email address, with subject line starting with 2DV610. Questions that are non-personal will be answered in Slack and a short notice in the email. https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/ 
 * Lectures will contain important information about the assignments and course so attend them.
 * Lectures will be broadcasted on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ECu6oCOLic Normally these are recorded and links to recordings will be posted, but participate in the online lectures! Some parts of the lectures may include work so you should make sure you have a working headset and preferably a webcam. You can ask questions and interact through the YouTube chat.
 * Lectures will also be given on campus Kalmar.
 * The tutoring time should be used to get you started and are provided so that you can ask questions about the assignments
 

TODO:
 * Join slack now since that will be your way of asking questions! https://coursepress.slack.com/messages/2dv610/  You have to register on slack to get access.
 * Download and install Eclipse, JUnit 4.
 * Join GitHub and create a repository. If you have no experience with git, read up on it!

See you next week and I wish you an awesome course!
